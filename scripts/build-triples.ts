/**
 * Emits the corpus as RDF: N-Triples for the whole graph at public/api/v1/nuclide.nt, and one small Turtle file per
 * record at public/api/v1/rdf/<id>.ttl (the record's own properties, outgoing relations and owl:sameAs, with the
 * prefixes declared once). The vocabulary is in scripts/rdf.ts, shared by both writers.
 *
 * The per-record files are only rewritten when their content changes, and files for ids that no longer exist are
 * removed, so incremental builds stay fast and the directory never holds stale records.

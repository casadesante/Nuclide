          <p>A service worker keeps a copy of the site shell, the search index, the molecule structures you have seen and up to a few hundred visited pages. When the network is slow or absent it serves those copies. Nothing about you is stored; the cache holds only public pages. Install Nuclide from your browser menu to open it like an app.</p>
          <p className="mt-2">Your <Link className="underline" href="/saved/">saved views and watchlist</Link> are kept separately in this browser and work offline too.</p>
